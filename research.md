## Current research

### _Investigating Environmental Decision-Making, Climate Change Adaptation, and Conflict_
I am currently interested in the role of behavioral science in promoting adaptive responses to resource scarcity, conflict, and projected climate change impacts. In this domain I am interested in utilizing current research from the environmental and behavioral sciences to work on specific cases of environmental degradation and resource scarcity in ways that help promote effective resource management and local stakeholder engagement. As recent reports point to a growing relationship between climate change and dimensions of human conflict, one focus of this work is to develop frameworks of individual and group-level social processes related to adaptation, resource management, and the potential sources of conflict that may arise. Given the scale, complexity, and multidimensional nature of these issues, I am actively engaging in and pursuing further interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers in environmental conservation, sociology, political science, marine science, and other related fields.
